    <p>Hi! My name is Zhihui Zhu.‍When I was a child, I would 
        often spend entire afternoons investigating the stones in my garden, 
        the insects on the ground, and other common things that anyone could 
        find but most choose to ignore. As I grew up, I tried my best to remember 
        and attend to the smallest and most easily-overlooked things. So I gradually 
        become a photography lover   📷 , because that enabled me to remain observant 
        and capture even the tiniest moments that touched me.‍Observing and learning 
        determines my input, but design enables my output and renders my thoughts 
        useful things. And that is my understanding of what it means to be a 
        "designer of thinking".‍I have always believed that patience and aggression, 
        hard work and relaxation can exist simultaneously. ‍I really look forward to 
        and am excited about working in a group in which everyone is enthusiastic 
        about what they and their colleagues are doing. ‍I anticipate hearing from you!
    </p>
