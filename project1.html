      <h1>UX Designer for Eventelper</h1>
      <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
      <p>Currently, whenever students want to participate in some events, they need to spend 
          a lot of effort on checking emails, Slack, Group Me, and other different social 
          platforms. They might also need to join a specific group before they can 
          receive relative information. And whenever they register for events, they 
          need to copy and paste them into their schedule app manually by themselves. 
          What makes it even more difficult is that when students want to cancel a 
          registration, they need to find the specific email in a pile of inboxes and 
          click on a special link offered to cancel. The whole process is very cumbersome.
      </p>
      <p>
          By offering searching, registering, flexible cancelation functions for events 
          participants, and feedback collection, more accurate (by adding reminder for 
          participants) participants data for events organizers, Eventeplter becomes 
          the all-in-one app for students who are dealing with on-campus events relative 
          things.
