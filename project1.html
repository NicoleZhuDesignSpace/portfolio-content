    <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
    <p>Currently, whenever students want to participate in some events, they need to spend 
        a lot of effort on checking emails, Slack, Group Me, and other different social 
        platforms. They might also need to join a specific group before they can 
        receive relative information. And whenever they register for events, they 
        need to copy and paste them into their schedule app manually by themselves. 
        What makes it even more difficult is that when students want to cancel a 
        registration, they need to find the specific email in a pile of inboxes and 
        click on a special link offered to cancel. The whole process is very cumbersome.
    </p>
    <p>
        By offering searching, registering, flexible cancelation functions for events 
        participants, and feedback collection, more accurate (by adding reminder for 
        participants) participants data for events organizers, Eventeplter becomes 
        the all-in-one app for students who are dealing with on-campus events relative 
        things.
